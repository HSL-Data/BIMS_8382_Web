## Exercise set 1

Re-create the plot below:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('exe1.png')
```

* Start with the `ggplot()` function using the gm data.

* Create an aesthetic mapping of `gdpPercap` to the x-axis and `total_perthou` to the y-axis.

* Add points to the plot: Make the points size 3, use "pch = 25", and map continent onto the aesthetics of the point

* Use a scale_x_reverse scale for the x-axis.

## Exercise set 2

1. Make a scatter plot of `lifeexp` on the y-axis against `year` on the x.
1. Make a series of small multiples faceting on continent.
1. Add a fitted curve, smooth or lm, with and without facets.
1. **Bonus**: using `geom_line()` and and aesthetic mapping `country` to `group=`, make a "spaghetti plot", showing _semitransparent_ lines connected for each country, faceted by continent. Add a smoothed loess curve with a thick (`lwd=3`) line with no standard error stripe. Reduce the opacity (`alpha=`) of the individual black lines. _Don't_ show Oceania countries (that is, `filter()` the data where `continent!="Oceania"` before you plot it).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2) 
gm <- read_csv(file="gapminder.csv")
plot <- ggplot(filter(gm, continent!='Oceania'), aes(year, lifeexp)) + facet_wrap(~continent)
plot <- plot + geom_line(aes(group = country), alpha = 0.2) + geom_smooth(lwd = 3, se = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
plot
```

## Exercise set 3

1. Make a jittered strip plot of GDP per capita against continent.
1. Make a box plot of GDP per capita against continent.
1. Using a log<sub>10</sub> y-axis scale, overlay semitransparent jittered points on top of box plots, where outlying points are colored. 
1. **BONUS**: Try to reorder the continents on the x-axis by GDP per capita. Why isn't this working as expected? See `?reorder` for clues.


## Exercise set 4

1. Plot a histogram of GDP Per Capita.
1. Do the same but use a log<sub>10</sub> x-axis.
1. Still on the log<sub>10</sub> x-axis scale, try a density plot mapping continent to the fill of each density distribution, and reduce the opacity.
1. Still on the log<sub>10</sub> x-axis scale, make a histogram faceted by continent _and_ filled by continent. Facet with a single column (see `?facet_wrap` for help). 
1. Save this figure to a 6x10 PDF file.

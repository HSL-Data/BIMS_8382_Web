### About this course

This course introduces methods, tools, and software for reproducibly managing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale biomedical data. Specifically, the course introduces the R statistical computing environment and packages for manipulating and visualizing high-dimensional data, covers strategies for reproducible research, and culminates with analyses of real biomedical data using R and Bioconductor packages.

**This is not a _"Tool X"_ or _"Software Y"_ class.** We want you to take away from this series the ability to use an extremely powerful scientific computing environment (R) to do many of the things that you’ll do _across study designs and disciplines_ -- managing, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing large, sometimes high-dimensional data. Whether that data is gene expression data from yeast, microbial genomics data from _B. pertussis_, public health data from [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/), RNA-seq data from humans, influenza outbreak data, movie preference trends from Netflix, or truck routing data from FedEx, you’ll need the same computational know-how and data literacy to do the same kinds of basic tasks in each. We might show you how to use specific tools here and there, but these are not important -- you probably won't be using the same specific software or methods 10 years from now, but you'll still use the same underlying data and computational foundation. **That** is the point of this series -- to arm you with a basic foundation, and more importantly, to **enable you to figure out how to use _this tool_ or _that tool_ on your own**, when you need to.

**_This is not a statistics class._** There are short lessons on essential statistics using R and regression in R but these lessons offer neither a comprehensive background on underlying theory nor in-depth coverage of implementation strategies using R. Some general knowledge of statistics and study design is helpful, but isn’t required for this course.


## [Setup](setup.html)

**Prior to the first class session**:
You should set aside a couple hours to download, install, and test all the software needed for the course. All the software we're using in class is open-source and freely available online. This setup must be completed _prior to class_, as we will not have much time for troubleshooting software installation issues during class. [Email us](people.html) if you're having difficulty.

Because of this course's format as an online module, here we provide best options for following along during class sessions. Most of the course consists of live coding, so the challenge will be how to simultaneously view the instructor's screen and your screen given that the RStudio window is large.

1. _Best option_ Dual monitors side-by-side
2. Two computers side-by-side
3. One computer (you) and one tv (instructor)
4. One computer (you) and one tablet (instructor)
5. One computer (you & instructor) and PDF of printed codes

## Course Schedule

### March 26: Intro to R

This novice-level introduction is directed toward life scientists with little to no experience with statistical computing or bioinformatics. This interactive introduction will introduce the R statistical computing environment. The first part of this session will demonstrate very basic functionality in R, including functions, vectors, creating variables, getting help, and reading/writing files. 

### March 31: RMarkdown and dplyr

This session covers some of the barriers to reproducible research and how to start to address some of those problems. We will cover using RMarkdown and RStudio to combine text and executable code to create readable and shareable reports. In the process of writing RMarkdown documents we will also explore the _dplyr_ package. The _dplyr_ package in R will help us to effectively manipulate and conditionally compute summary statistics over subsets of a "big" dataset containing many observations.

### April 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (David)

This session will introduce the idea of "tidy data", and will introduce R packages that enable data manipulation and plotting to explore a dataset and understand what steps must be taken to clean the data. 

### April 7: Data Visualization with ggplot2 (David)

This session will cover fundamental concepts for creating effective data visualization and will introduce tools and techniques for visualizing large, high-dimensional data using R. We will review fundamental concepts for visually displaying quantitative information, such as using series of small multiples, avoiding "chart-junk," and maximizing the data-ink ratio. After briefly covering data visualization using base R graphics, we will introduce the _ggplot2_ package for advanced high-dimensional visualization. We will cover the grammar of graphics (geoms, aesthetics, stats, and faceting), and using ggplot2 to create plots layer-by-layer. Upon completing this lesson, students will be able to use R to explore a high-dimensional dataset by faceting and scaling arbitrarily complex plots in small multiples.

### April 9: Advanced Exploratory Analysis (David)

Riffing off of Tolstoy, Hadley Wickham, the writer of many of the R packages we will use, says "Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way". Upon completing this lesson, students will be able to use the _tidyr_, _stringr_, _dplyr_, and _ggplot2_ packages in R to clean and explore their data.

### April 14: TidyTuesday Challenge 1

Each week RStudio releases a new dataset in a TidyTuesday challenge so we will each load the dataset, manipulate it as needed, and create a data visualization that tells a story. At the end of the session we will share our viz with each other and look at some other coders' contributions on Twitter to get some fresh ideas.

### April 16: Essential Statistics (Marieke)

This workshop will provide hands-on instruction and exercises covering basic statistical analyses in R. This will cover descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, linear models, and methods for discrete variable analysis. We will cover hypothesis testing and assessing the assumptions of the tests.

### April 21: Regression (Marieke)

This session will focus solely on conducting regression analyses in R. It will begin with an overview of regression analysis and then move on to specific techniques which include: linear models, logistic regression, and multiple regression. We will also focus on methods to check model assumptions and to select the "best" model.

### April 23: Dimension Reduction (Marieke)

In this session we will investigate techniques for inspecting, visualizing, and reducing dimensions for high-dimensional data. We will examine techniques like PCA, clustering, and heatmaps that are useful for any number of large datasets.

### April 28: Intro to High Performance Computing (Jackie Huband)

- How to log onto Rivanna
- Loading R modules
- Intro to SLURM
- Intro to multicore (multithread) with R

### April 30: RNASeq (Gladys Andino Bautista)

Description TBD

### May 5 & 7: Student Presentations

So much of learning biomedical datascience will be up to you. You each are studying a different topic with varying computational needs. As such, we would like you to choose a package we did not cover at length in class and create a vignette demoing for the class what the package is for and a few of its functions. You will turn in a rendered PDF of your vignette and will provide a 15min presentation with a partner, allowing time for audience questions. This assignment is worth 20% of your course grade. As an example of a vignette, please see UVA Library's Clay Ford's vignette of the [pwr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html)

## Homework

Each week's lesson will be followed by an independent homework assignment that will be posted to our course's Collab site. The HW will be due the following Monday at 11:59pm. Homework assignments should be completed in RMarkdown and should be submitted as a single PDF file to our course's Collab site. In total there will be 5 homework assignments due April 6, April 13, April 20, April 27, and May 4.

## Grading Policy

* 80% Homeworks -- each worth 16%
* 20% Presentation and vignette

## FAQ 

### What are the pre-requisites?

_There are none!_ This course does not assume any knowledge of programming or using a command-line interface, but if you've have had any experience here, the content won't come as so much of a shock. But _don't panic._ Command-line interfaces and programming languages like R are _incredibly powerful_ and will be utterly transformative on your research. There's a learning curve, and it's near-vertical in the beginning, but it's surmountable and the payoff is worth it! 

### Do I need a laptop?

**YES.** You must have access to a computer on which you can install software. The class will be primarily live coding with activities for you to independently code. As such, ideally you would have 2 monitors allowing you to follow along with the instructor in one screen while you code in a second. Please follow the [setup instructions](setup.html) prior to the workshop.

### Where can I get more help?

Glad you asked! [See here](help.html).
